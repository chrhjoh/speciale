This is the written piece of work for the thesis \textit{"Predicing TCR pMHC interactions using deep learning"}. The code used in this thesis is available on github at the repository: \url{https://github.com/chrhjoh/speciale}. 

The work has been done at the Immunoinformatics and Machine Learning group at DTU Health Tech from the 31th of January 2022 to the 24th of June 2022 and corresponds to 30 ECTS points.
I would like to thank Prof. Morten Nielsen for the invaluable guidance and supervision throughout this project and Alessandro Montemurro for great discussions surrounding the project and the data.
