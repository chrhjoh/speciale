# Prediction TCR:pMHC interactions using Deep Learning

The interaction between T cell receptors (TCRs) and peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) is vital for a functioning immune system, and understanding this interaction has potential applications within vaccine development and cancer treatments.

## Data
The data used consists of the sequences of bla bla bla MHC is HLA-A*02:01. Multiple common peptide epitopes. Alpha and beta chains of the variable domain of the TCR.

## Project goal
The overall goal of this project is to develop deep learning methods to predict interactions between TCRs and pMHC.
However in the process multiple sub-goals have been established.

* Understand which parts of the dataset has a significant meaning for predicting the interaction
* Simplify a previous model developed in another course for easier understanding of model behavior.
